# RAINBOWPRINT

This blueprint document consists of a range of equality plans that entities and governments from cities can use to establish general principles for  LGBTQ+ actions and responsibility programs using the Celo blockchain as the enabler.

We live in a world where +60 countries still have laws criminalizing the LGBTQ+ community. However, recent years have also seen significant advances in countries across the globe, with LGBTQ+ politicians occupying leadership roles and same-sex marriage legally recognized in more and more countries.

On the other hand, blockchain technology is excellent for circumventing oppressive powers but does not necessarily provide the rights and freedoms that members of the LGBTQ+ community deserve.

We need a movement to act locally with cities as triggers of change, their citizens improving respect for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, and, at the same time, LGBTQ+ people embracing a cutting-edge technologic innovation out of necessity.
With its ability to offer decentralized finance, inclusivity, mobility, and different organizational protocols, the Celo blockchain will act as a facilitator.

Let’s focus on the critical actions cities can take to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning + people from violence and discrimination and provide access to healthcare, financial services, and welcoming spaces via the Celo blockchain.

WEB3 PRIDE ACTIONS:

- Potentiate LGBTQ+ social tokens as they are ideal for building community support for talent and small businesses without the risk of being de-platformed.

- Begin to use blockchain to deliver diverse forms of family partnership certificates (proof of marriage/marriage certificates).
Couples could verify their details and sign a declaration using a mobile app to leverage the mobile features from the Celo blockchain.
The benefits can impact the lives and finances of LGBTQ+ partners unlocking access to a network of organizations and providers’ perks: life insurance, spousal employer benefits, etc.
The Famiee project inspires this in Japan.

- Place HIV tests on the blockchain.
Placing the HIV tests in the Celo blockchain would make them transparent and traceable, helping to prevent HIV from spreading among vulnerable populations.
Additionally, granting access and funding to reliable and affordable HIV tests without visiting unfriendly healthcare centres is a crucial benefit of using blockchain by local entities.

- Sponsor an annual LGBTQ+ NFT collection.
All the proceeds from the NFT collection would go to build meaningful and inspirational inclusive spaces honouring the LGBTQ+ community in the city – places where hope is rekindled.
And put them behind projects of common interest and fund LGBTQ+ organizations without the funds being blocked by anti-LGBTQ+ laws.
The friends of Harvey Milk Plaza NFT Collection have to be a source of inspiration to other cities.

- Invest in LGBTQ+ DAOs and create opportunities in a safe space to communicate, have a say in their governance, and find a way to give back to the local and global LGTBQ+ communities.

- Vote on the most deserving projects.
The Media industry has traditionally been closed off to new voices in films, arts and culture festivals promoted by city councils.
Blockchain technology has the power to enable quadratic/conviction voting to promote talent and content curation and allow for greater inclusion of LGBTQ+ artists.
In this way, city citizens can vote on the most deserving projects without bias.


This blueprint concludes that essential factors in determining LGBTQ+ cities’ actions and success in the blockchain ecosystem may be a collaboration across sectors and a strategic planning and partnerships program between LGBTQ+ policy agencies, LGBTQ+ movement actors, and citizens.
They will impact the economic well-being and quality of life in a world of diversity.
